      If one is lucky enough to be able to create things,
      one does never stop to create things.
      Therefore I always create. With everything I do. Creating is not just
      a job, it defines the way of how you see the world.

      I myself am happy like clam to be able to see and understand the world
      a little bit different and to be able to create beautiful things
      out of it.
