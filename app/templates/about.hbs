    making radio and loud guitars.
    Therefore, this is basically what you'll find on this website.

    Everything you see is done by me, including background pics
    (expect the ones I'm on it, obviously.
    These are done by <a href="https://twitter.com/grenzbild">@ad.kat</a>)

    what you wanna do. I'm open minded for projects you're passioned
    about. So share your ideas and thoughts with me and let's create awesome
